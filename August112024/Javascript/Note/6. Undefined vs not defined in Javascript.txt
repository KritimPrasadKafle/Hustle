1. Undefined is an Special Keyword and Placeholder Which is kept inside the Variable until some Values are not defined to it. It will stay inside the variables if  no value is not Assigned.
2. undefined!=not defined, Because undefined means variable is declared but no value is Assigned and not defined means Variable is not even declared.
3. JS is an Loosely Typed Language or Weakly Typed Language, You can Use same variable to store String, Integer, Boolean type Values in same.
Example: 
var a;
console.log(a);
a=10;
console.log(a);
a="hello JS";
console.log(a);





1. Undefined is like a placeholder till a variable is not assigned a value.
2. undefined !== not defined
3. JS- weakly typed language since it doesn't depend on data type declarations.






1.Undefined is a Special Placeholder which is used to reserve memory for the variables in the memory creation phase. Even before a single line of code is executed JS engine assigns undefined to the variables.

2.Not Defined means if we try to console or access any variable which is not declared in the code then we get Not Defined error.

3. JS is a loosely typed language or weakly typed language means it does not attaches its variables to specific data types like in C++ and java.

4.Remember undefined !== not defined.
