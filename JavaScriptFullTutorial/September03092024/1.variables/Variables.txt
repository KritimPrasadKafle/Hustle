Node Js is one which would be able to execute our javascript files.
Node Js is the environment. 

Constant cannot be changed whereas the variables can be changed in upcoming time.

const, var, let these keywords have been inject in the environment so it would be knowing what can do what?

What ever we would be doing in the code, Nodejs would be knowing what We need to do.

const cannot be changed.

let something = something;

variable has been reserved in the memory and value has been also reserved.


To declare variables we can use let and var.


{

}

this is called as scope.

we shouldn't use var because if we use var then we can assign the value to the same variable multiple times which can cause an error.
 
Prefer not to use var because of issue in block scope and functional scope.
